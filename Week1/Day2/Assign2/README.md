# Assignment 2 Response

One major limitation with my solution is that I need to be explicit with everything, since what types I read in has to be known at compile time, so I can't just let the user give a number, or a string, and tell them the `sizeof` for that value.

In a language like Python or C#, I could use Run-time Type Information (RTTI) to tell the type of a value at runtime and dynamically handle it, even if I don't know what type the user is going to give to the program at compile time.
